# Astute Abroad ‚úàÔ∏èüåè

**Built by Vanessa Davis**

Astute Abroad is a web app designed to help users practice and improve their spoken Korean with real-time AI feedback.  
**Currently focused on Korean**, but with plans to expand to **more languages** as the platform grows.  
Inspired by Vanessa's experience living overseas in Korea as an expat, Astute Abroad is the first step in helping learners gain the confidence to travel, connect, and speak freely.

## External API Integrations

Astute Abroad relies on the following third-party APIs to deliver real-time speech processing, AI-powered feedback, and secure user authentication:

### üîä Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API

- **Purpose**: Converts user audio into live text for evaluation.
- **How it's used**: Streams audio via WebSocket to Google STT for transcription.
- **Setup**:
  - Requires a JSON credentials object in your server `.env` as:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_STT_API_KEY={ ...your JSON credentials... }
    ```
  - Ensure the service account has permission for the Speech-to-Text API.

### üß† OpenAI GPT-3.5 API

- **Purpose**: Analyzes spoken responses and provides personalized feedback.
- **How it's used**: The backend sends transcripts and prompts to the API for evaluation.
- **Setup**:
  - Add your API key in the server `.env`:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

### üîê Firebase Authentication

- **Purpose**: Handles user registration, login, and authentication state.
- **How it's used**: Frontend uses Firebase SDK to register and sign in users. The backend maps Firebase UID to internal user records.
- **Setup**:

  - Configure Firebase project in your client-side code using:

    ```js
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "your-api-key",
      authDomain: "your-app.firebaseapp.com",
      ...
    };

    initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    ```

### üõ°Ô∏è Google reCAPTCHA v2

- **Purpose**: Protects against bot signups and abuse.
- **How it's used**: Shown on the registration/login forms and verified before backend processing.
- **Setup**:
  - Add keys to your client and server `.env` files:
    ```env
    VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_site_key
    VITE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    ```
  - Frontend uses the `react-google-recaptcha` package for integration.

## Reflection

Building Astute Abroad deepened my skills in:

- Real-time audio processing and WebSockets
- Prompt engineering for AI feedback
- Secure authentication flows with Firebase and reCAPTCHA
- Designing responsive, animated UIs with Framer Motion
- Structuring and deploying full-stack applications

Lessons learned:

- The importance of clear API documentation and test coverage
- Balancing user experience with security measures like rate limiting and reCAPTCHA

I truly enjoyed building this app, which felt like a labor of love. Astute Abroad combines my passion for travel, language learning (particularly Korean), and my budding talent in software engineering. Thank you for taking a look into a project I am super proud of.

With Gratitude,
Vanessa
