## MVP Proposal

### One-Sentence Pitch
A web application that enables users to practice speaking a foreign language using AI-driven feedback on both content accuracy and pronunciation.

### Problem Statement  
Many language learners struggle to practice speaking skills due to limited opportunities for real-time, personalized feedbackâ€”especially regarding pronunciation and content accuracy. Additionally, many learners feel too shy or self-conscious to practice speaking publicly or with native speakers, which significantly hinders their progress and confidence.

### Target Users
- Language learners (from beginners to intermediate users)
- Individuals seeking conversational practice
- Students and professionals preparing for language exams or travel

### Core Features
- **Voice Input Practice:** Users speak responses to language-learning questions.
- **AI Feedback:** Integration with OpenAI to analyze and provide feedback on content and pronunciation.
- **Web Scraping:** Automatic fetching and categorization of language-learning questions.
- **User Dashboard:** Progress tracking with data visualization (charts, stats).
- **Search & Favorites:** Functionality to search questions by category/difficulty and save favorites.
- **Authentication:** User login and registration via Firebase.

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React, with a styling framework (Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL hosted on Render
- **APIs:** 
  - OpenAI API for AI feedback
  - Google Speech-to-Text for voice transcription
  - Firebase for authentication
- **Web Scraping:** Puppeteer for extracting language questions

### Preliminary Wireframes or Sketches
- **Landing Page:** Simple introduction with demo video, and login/sign-up options.
- **Practice Page:** Displays a question, audio recording button, and a text area for feedback.
- **Dashboard:** Visual progress charts, practice history, and saved questions.
- **Search Interface:** Search bar with filtering options.

### API Endpoints and Integration Plans
- **Web Scraping Endpoint:** `POST /api/scrape-questions` to fetch and store questions.
- **Question Retrieval:** `GET /api/questions` with query parameters for category and difficulty.
- **User Authentication:** `POST /api/users/login` to authenticate using Firebase.
- **Saved Questions:** `POST /api/users/save-question` and `GET /api/users/saved-questions`.
- **Practice Attempts:** `POST /api/practice/attempt` to submit voice inputs and receive AI feedback.
- **User Progress:** `GET /api/users/progress` for dashboard metrics.
- Integration plans include setting up middleware for error handling, authentication, and rate limiting.

### Component Breakdown
- **Frontend Components:**
  - **App Shell:** Navigation, routing, and layout.
  - **Practice Component:** Handles voice input, displays questions, and shows AI feedback.
  - **Dashboard Component:** Displays progress charts and practice history.
  - **Search Component:** Provides search and filter functionalities.
  - **Authentication Components:** Login, registration, and session management.
- **Backend Components:**
  - **API Routes:** CRUD operations for questions, users, and practice attempts.
  - **Scraping Module:** Puppeteer scripts with error handling and logging.
  - **Integration Modules:** Modules for OpenAI, Google Speech-to-Text, and Firebase interactions.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** For individual functions (e.g., data parsing, API calls) using Jest.
- **Integration Tests:** For API endpoints and overall user flows (e.g., login, practice session) using Supertest.
- **Coverage Target:** Aim for at least 80% coverage on core functionalities.
- **Manual Testing:** Conduct cross-browser and accessibility testing.
