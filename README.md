# üåè Astute Abroad
## üìå Project Plan Overview
This project is a **language learning app** that integrates Google speech-to-text, Google translate, real-time AI-powered feedback, and a database of language-learning questions categorized by purpose (e.g., Travel, Business, Casual Conversations). It is built using **React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Puppeteer for web scraping**.

## üìÖ Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1: Core Setup, Web Scraping, and Data Pipeline
- Set up React frontend and Node.js backend.
- Configure PostgreSQL on Render and define the database schema (users, questions, saved_questions, practice_attempts).
- Connect the OpenAI API.
- Develop a Puppeteer-based web scraper to fetch language-learning questions.
- Process and store scraped questions in PostgreSQL, categorized by purpose and difficulty.
- Build an API endpoint to fetch questions by category.
- Add error handling and logging for the scraping process.

---

### Week 2: Voice Input, AI Feedback, and Core App Features
- Implement the Google Speech-to-Text API for capturing user voice input.
- Build the practice session UI to display questions and capture audio responses.
- Integrate OpenAI API to compare transcribed input with expected answers, providing text-based content accuracy feedback.
- Develop AI-driven pronunciation feedback using STT confidence scores.
- Set up Firebase authentication for login/signup.
- Create a search functionality to filter stored questions by category and difficulty.
- Integrate basic AI-based question suggestions based on user conversation history.

---

### Week 3: UX Enhancements, Dashboard, and Final Deployment
- Implement functionality for users to favorite and save questions.
- Add pagination support for both the questions list and saved questions.
- Build a user dashboard displaying progress metrics and charts.
- Enhance web accessibility by adding ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and fixing color contrast issues.
- Implement client-side form validation across the app.
- Write unit and integration tests covering core features.
- Improve error handling to provide clear user-facing messages.
- Conduct final testing and deploy the application on Render.

## üå≥ Branching Strategy
- **main**: Stable production-ready branch
- **develop**: Active development branch (merged into `main` upon feature completion)
- **feature/[feature-name]**: Individual feature branches (e.g., `feature/chat-ui`)
- **bugfix/[bug-name]**: Fixes for specific bugs (e.g., `bugfix/api-timeout`)

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Workflow
1. Developers create feature branches from `develop`.
2. Once a feature or bugfix is complete, a **pull request (PR)** is made to merge into `develop`.
3. After testing and approval, `develop` is merged into `main`.

| API Rate Limits (OpenAI, Google Speech-to-Text) | Medium         | High       | Implement caching, exponential backoff, and fallback mechanisms. Monitor API usage and consider alternative providers if needed.                         |
| Web Scraping Blocks                         | Medium         | High       | Maintain a local cache of scraped data; schedule scraping during off-peak times; use proxies if necessary.                                                |
| Inaccurate AI Feedback                      | Medium         | High       | Regularly validate AI output with human review; adjust prompt engineering; implement user feedback loops.                                              |
| Authentication & Security Issues            | Low            | High       | Use Firebase authentication with secure session management; enforce token expiration; apply best practices for API security.                             |
| Performance Bottlenecks (API calls, Database queries) | Medium         | Medium     | Optimize queries, implement pagination, use indexing on critical fields, and consider load balancing as user base grows.                                |
| Data Privacy and Compliance                 | Low            | High       | Ensure compliance with relevant data protection laws; use encryption for sensitive data; maintain clear privacy policies.                                |
| Project Scope Creep                         | Medium         | Medium     | Clearly define MVP features; maintain a prioritized backlog; postpone non-critical features to future phases.                                           |
