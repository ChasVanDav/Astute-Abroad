        About Astute Abroad
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Astute Abroad</strong> was founded by a former overseas language
        educator from the United States who spent years living and teaching in
        South Korea. Fluent in Korean and deeply immersed in cross-cultural
        communication, they experienced firsthand both the challenges and the
        incredible rewards of becoming fluent in another language—and navigating
        life in a new country.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Born out of a passion for language learning and a desire to make the
        journey smoother for others, Astute Abroad is more than just a language
        app or travel resource. It's a comprehensive platform designed to
        empower learners to{" "}
        <span className="italic">speak fluently and travel fluidly</span>.
        Whether you're a student preparing for a study abroad semester, a remote
        worker heading overseas, or a curious traveler with dreams of connecting
        more deeply with the world—Astute Abroad is your guide.

        One of the core missions of Astute Abroad is to create a safe,
        supportive space for everyone—including those who may feel shy, nervous,
        or self-conscious about practicing a new language. We understand that
        speaking out loud can be intimidating, especially for beginners. That’s
        why our platform allows you to practice in private, free from fear of
        embarrassment or judgment. You can make mistakes, try again, and improve
        at your own pace—confidently and comfortably.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        At the heart of Astute Abroad is advanced AI technology that
        personalizes your learning experience like never before. Our platform
        listens to your pronunciation and gives real-time feedback, helping you
        sound more like a native speaker with every session. Through intelligent
        algorithms, Astute Abroad also tracks your progress, corrects your
        answers, and offers tailored suggestions so you can improve efficiently
        and effectively.
